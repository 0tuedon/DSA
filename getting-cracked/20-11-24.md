1. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

2. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. Link

3. Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. (Take Home) Link
